              “Dear as Salt” is a web-based game inspired by the tale Dear as
              salt (or Bene come il sale, in italian) from Italo Calvino’s
              Italian Fables, published for the first time in 1956. The story
              originally comes from Bologna and, telling the story of a young
              princess banished by her father, is able to draw attention to the
              power of misunderstandings, but also to every kitchen’s must:
              salt, no less.

              In the game, you are the king and make your choices with the goal
              of reigning the kingdom as well as possible. Because salt is the
              most important element in the story, many of the choices you can
              revolve around it. You will meet many of the characters from the
              tale as well as someones, like a wizard or an alchemist, who will
              appear randomly. If your choices benefit the people of your
              kingdom as well as the economy, you will be rewarded with a good
              final score.
